# CD Placement Assignment
An optional assignment in my Programming 2 class (COP3337) @ FIU. Purpose is to determine if the student is ready to be in the class. This assignment was assigned by Gregory Shaw, who is a senior instructor at FIU. He teaches various programming classes.

The problem is provided in these links:

The wording in this document in not concise and is all over the place. Repeated things are asked for, the step-by-step instructions are vague, and the formula given to us, while is helpful, leaves out an important part for a piece of data he is asking for (interest for the year, which is I = A - P; original formula: A = P + I). 

If you were someone like me who has not been with any sort of math class for quite some time, you may be puzzled at first. Yes, figuring out the math for this assignment is simple; HOWEVER, I came in to the assignment believing all I had to do was code something, not have to figure out how compound interest works. While simple, I thought I just had to practice programming using ArrayLists in a simple form, but not make a legit certificate of deposit simulator.

Gregory Shaw's style is a bit oudated. Many studies show that interactive learning is better for students; however he does not teach this way. Instead, he teaches from his outdated '97 word documents with barely no interactive teaching whatsoever. Some may struggle with his class. The funny thing is that Shaw admitted he is one of the worst instructors for programming classes (he jokes a lot, but was he serious about this one? A lot of students do dislike him, but there are far worst programming instructors at FIU).

Anyways, I am providing the source code for this assignment or anyone interested in how it works. There are many solutions to this assignment; so do not take mine as a perfect one. My code indeed can be improved, but this a solution nontheless.
